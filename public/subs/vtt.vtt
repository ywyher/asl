WEBVTT

00:13.330 --> 00:15.160
Goto Ryuji isn't fighting.

00:15.160 --> 00:19.370
But thanks to that, I can witness
a battle between S-Rank Hunters.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.180
Now...

00:25.210 --> 00:27.010
Let's begin.

00:35.720 --> 00:39.480
SOLO LEVELING SEASON 2
-ARISE FROM THE SHADOW-

02:06.770 --> 02:08.270
You want to compare strengths?

02:08.850 --> 02:10.730
That makes it simple.

02:10.730 --> 02:13.950
Alright, let's see who's stronger.

02:22.500 --> 02:25.460
He's fast! I shouldn't get into
close combat with him!

02:29.210 --> 02:32.380
My expertise lies in long-range combat.

02:34.880 --> 02:36.970
Hoshino, that is too dangerous.

02:36.970 --> 02:39.050
Take him down quickly.

02:43.810 --> 02:49.130
Master, this arena is reinforced
with top-tier magic gems, right?

02:49.130 --> 02:50.270
Yes.

02:50.270 --> 02:53.900
But it seems we need to reassess
the reinforcement standards.

02:55.200 --> 02:58.910
They're the top-tier Hunters
even among S-Ranks.

02:58.910 --> 03:01.120
Merely restraining their arms won't suffice.

03:01.120 --> 03:03.450
You must be prepared
to break them if necessary.

03:04.880 --> 03:05.770
Yikes!

03:07.210 --> 03:08.920
Atsushi Kumamoto, was it?

03:09.420 --> 03:12.230
Seems he's not the combative type.

03:14.290 --> 03:15.260
Darn it.

03:15.260 --> 03:17.490
I'm bad at handling these situations.

03:17.490 --> 03:19.590
My resolve wasn't enough after all.

03:22.430 --> 03:26.460
He's probably using us to test them...

03:27.100 --> 03:29.310
...to see if they're ready to fight the ants.

03:33.730 --> 03:36.190
Since you chose me to test them,

03:36.640 --> 03:38.660
I'll gladly have them
give you an answer!

03:39.000 --> 03:40.120
I can't handle this!

03:45.000 --> 03:47.080
They're all monsters.

03:47.720 --> 03:49.880
An A-Rank like me stands no chance.

03:50.210 --> 03:52.000
That's not true!

03:52.000 --> 03:54.110
You're plenty strong too, Master!

03:56.720 --> 03:59.180
Looks like I've won this match.

04:00.220 --> 04:02.260
I got smashed into the ground.

04:02.970 --> 04:04.600
This is the first time for me.

04:05.680 --> 04:06.500
Ugh...

04:06.500 --> 04:08.310
Does this count as my win?

04:10.370 --> 04:10.770
Tch.

04:11.430 --> 04:13.190
How long will you keep running—

04:16.400 --> 04:19.070
Do you think I'm weaker
than Hunter Cha?

04:19.420 --> 04:21.200
I'm being underestimated.

04:22.740 --> 04:24.540
I can't read her movements.

04:24.540 --> 04:26.450
The Dancer Cha Hae-in.

04:26.870 --> 04:29.160
After seeing her dance-like footwork,

04:29.160 --> 04:31.830
it's clear her title is well-deserved.

04:35.250 --> 04:36.300
Touch.

04:36.850 --> 04:38.940
I need to help Hunter Baek.

04:45.510 --> 04:46.970
What kind of move was that?!

04:46.970 --> 04:48.230
Oh, no.

04:48.230 --> 04:49.980
I acted reflexively.

04:54.360 --> 04:57.190
He's about to lose his temper...

04:57.570 --> 05:00.900
Once he becomes like that,
no one knows what he might do.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.740
Should we stop him?

05:03.310 --> 05:05.240
If there's a risk of injury.

05:09.870 --> 05:10.580
So fast.

05:15.010 --> 05:16.340
This doesn't look good.

05:22.840 --> 05:24.790
You could say I'm meddling,

05:25.760 --> 05:28.680
but this has gone
beyond friendly sparring.

05:28.680 --> 05:30.140
Who do you think you are?!

05:33.600 --> 05:34.650
No way.

05:34.650 --> 05:37.110
He instantly subdued
the enraged Kumamoto!

05:37.570 --> 05:40.490
Is he really a Mage?

05:40.490 --> 05:42.320
Yes, that's correct.

05:42.680 --> 05:45.030
I'll have to verify it myself.

05:45.570 --> 05:46.450
Hunter Cha.

05:46.950 --> 05:48.870
Shall we admit defeat?

05:49.590 --> 05:52.160
Hunter Baek appears to be eliminated too.

05:52.160 --> 05:52.830
Okay.

05:54.800 --> 05:58.300
Even though I was going all out,
I still couldn't win.

06:00.510 --> 06:01.880
Hunter Sung.

06:02.270 --> 06:06.600
Our guild master Goto asked
if he may request a match.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.010
He exudes combat spirit.

06:09.460 --> 06:12.020
Is he trying to gauge my strength?

06:13.230 --> 06:16.690
This is a great chance to test the power
I honed in the Demon's Castle.

06:17.930 --> 06:19.860
He actually smiled in my presence.

06:20.640 --> 06:21.940
Mr. Goto.

06:21.940 --> 06:24.280
Hunter Sung agreed.

06:24.280 --> 06:26.570
But with one condition.

06:26.570 --> 06:27.450
Condition?

06:27.870 --> 06:30.660
He stated he'd consent
only if you go all out.

06:33.690 --> 06:34.850
Interesting.

06:35.540 --> 06:39.250
The 4th Jeju Island
Raid Mission is imminent.

06:39.650 --> 06:43.850
Our nation will collaborate with Japan
to ensure complete preparations.

06:43.850 --> 06:46.050
Aren't you working today?

06:46.050 --> 06:48.390
It's my day off.
I told you yesterday.

06:48.390 --> 06:49.890
Did you?

06:49.890 --> 06:51.810
The Hunters are working hard.

06:51.810 --> 06:54.930
We should do our jobs properly too.

07:04.670 --> 07:05.820
Hello?

07:06.490 --> 07:07.110
Umm...

07:08.090 --> 07:11.370
I'd like to ask about the sentry team
of the Jeju Island Raid Mission.

07:12.080 --> 07:14.040
What's going on here?

07:14.380 --> 07:16.910
So he's the 10th S-Rank Hunter
everyone's talking about.

07:16.910 --> 07:19.750
He's quite fiery,
challenging Goto to a duel.

07:20.130 --> 07:23.210
I saw his combat skills
in A-Rank dungeons.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.770
But can he handle an S-Rank Hunter?

07:25.770 --> 07:27.970
You're surrounded by Hunters today.

07:27.970 --> 07:29.340
Do you feel alright?

07:29.870 --> 07:33.040
I can't go to the battlefield
holding my nose.

07:34.140 --> 07:36.440
We're not going to stop them?

07:36.440 --> 07:39.940
For a close combat
between a Fighter and a Mage,

07:40.420 --> 07:42.320
normally, we should have intervened.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.820
But my thoughts align with yours,
Hunter Cha.

07:47.310 --> 07:49.570
Don't you have expectations of him?

07:50.070 --> 07:51.790
If it's truly as I predicted...

07:51.790 --> 07:55.040
...that Hunter Sung is the Awakened
who can keep evolving...

07:57.600 --> 07:58.540
Then, let's start—

08:03.280 --> 08:05.130
Hey, I haven't finished speaking yet.

08:05.130 --> 08:07.340
With that kind of speed and movement...

08:07.710 --> 08:09.680
You claim you are a Mage?

08:09.680 --> 08:10.800
Don't make me laugh.

08:13.350 --> 08:15.720
I'll expose your true nature.

08:17.140 --> 08:20.480
True, he's completely different
from other S-Rank Hunters.

08:20.980 --> 08:22.020
But...

08:22.020 --> 08:23.860
I can still dodge.

08:23.860 --> 08:25.280
He smiled again.

08:25.730 --> 08:28.190
His attacks are too fast to see.

08:28.190 --> 08:30.410
He's dodging brilliantly.

08:30.750 --> 08:33.870
Just avoiding those attacks
is already remarkable.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.330
He's not just dodging.

08:36.790 --> 08:38.830
He's testing his opponent's strength.

08:43.540 --> 08:46.380
The more he dodges,
the angrier I get.

08:46.770 --> 08:47.800
I've changed my mind.

08:48.160 --> 08:49.830
I'll eliminate you with full power!

08:57.060 --> 08:58.310
Hunter Sung!

09:03.650 --> 09:06.520
I almost lost one of my eyes there.

09:06.900 --> 09:09.300
He didn't grab my wrist, but my hand.

09:09.300 --> 09:11.110
Are you mocking me?

09:11.490 --> 09:13.630
I don't understand you.

09:14.430 --> 09:16.740
But if I grabbed your wrist,
the game would end.

09:17.310 --> 09:20.080
You don't want it to end
like this either, do you?

09:31.440 --> 09:33.050
Hey, Mr. Goto is getting serious...

09:33.380 --> 09:36.550
If they keep fighting,
neither of them will come out unscathed!

09:45.400 --> 09:46.310
Ice?

09:47.550 --> 09:48.690
Hunter Sung!

09:49.140 --> 09:49.900
Mr. Goto!

09:50.270 --> 09:51.650
Let's stop here.

09:51.650 --> 09:54.320
No one can take responsibility
if something goes wrong.

09:54.830 --> 09:57.030
Please tell him the duel is over!

09:57.030 --> 09:58.490
Y-Yes.

10:01.140 --> 10:02.910
Did I interfere too much?

10:02.910 --> 10:03.540
No.

10:04.850 --> 10:09.340
Only getting a scratch from
fighting Goto, that's impressive.

10:12.250 --> 10:14.370
I got too carried away.

10:14.900 --> 10:15.680
However...

10:16.430 --> 10:19.740
Now I've known about everyone's strengths

10:19.740 --> 10:23.000
and infiltrated Shadow Soldiers
into their shadows.

10:25.230 --> 10:29.440
I'll send you the list of
raid mission participants later.

10:29.440 --> 10:32.820
Please also send it
to our vice guild master.

10:32.820 --> 10:33.810
I will.

10:38.950 --> 10:39.900
Chairman Go.

10:41.260 --> 10:43.750
What is it, Hunter Sung?

10:44.200 --> 10:46.410
Regarding the Jeju Island raid mission...

10:49.540 --> 10:50.580
Ryuji.

10:50.580 --> 10:53.170
There's an exceptionally
skilled Hunter here.

10:54.300 --> 10:57.470
But he can't be stronger than
the guild master of Draw Sword Guild.

10:57.470 --> 10:58.890
I'm not sure.

10:58.890 --> 11:00.510
Which Hunter are you referring to?

11:00.510 --> 11:01.970
Sung Jinwoo.

11:01.970 --> 11:04.680
He's a Reawakened,
who's recently promoted S-Rank Hunter.

11:05.850 --> 11:07.390
That's strange.

11:07.390 --> 11:10.870
This person isn't on
the raid mission's Hunter list.

11:10.870 --> 11:11.770
What?

11:13.860 --> 11:17.410
Hunter Sung is not joining
the Jeju Island raid mission?

11:17.410 --> 11:20.280
He must have his reasons.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.410
But...

11:21.780 --> 11:24.370
Byung-Gu isn't listed either...

11:24.780 --> 11:25.710
But...

11:26.080 --> 11:29.920
We now have 15 S-Rank Hunters.

11:30.380 --> 11:32.130
This time we must...

11:36.880 --> 11:38.510
...secure victory.

11:41.680 --> 11:42.640
I'm home.

11:42.640 --> 11:44.240
Big brother, you're late.

11:45.950 --> 11:47.640
Welcome back, Jinwoo.

11:48.060 --> 11:49.650
Dinner is ready.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.170
I'm back.

11:53.830 --> 11:56.360
My mother has awakened
after four years of sleep.

11:56.360 --> 11:58.070
She needs me now.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.280
That's why...

12:01.060 --> 12:02.700
I can't go to Jeju Island.

12:07.120 --> 12:10.670
Our food supplies ran out,
so we started eating each other.

12:11.510 --> 12:15.920
This land no longer
has food to nourish us.

12:17.010 --> 12:18.550
We can't continue like this.

12:19.020 --> 12:20.800
We must leave this island.

12:22.010 --> 12:24.010
We must have a stronger child...

12:24.490 --> 12:26.470
...to lead us.

12:26.470 --> 12:29.750
They need my powerful child.

13:05.260 --> 13:08.220
Grow stronger, my child.

13:15.670 --> 13:18.780
Ant-type monsters are evolving
at an alarming speed.

13:19.280 --> 13:22.660
During the 3rd Jeju raid mission,
ants were still crawling on the ground.

13:23.160 --> 13:26.160
This is the latest confirmed situation.

13:26.490 --> 13:30.620
Their forms now resemble those of humans
with massive wings on their backs.

13:31.040 --> 13:36.090
The Hunter's Association announced
new strategies against ant-type monsters.

13:39.380 --> 13:40.760
There you are, darn monster!

13:40.760 --> 13:42.890
I'll be your opponent
as an S-Rank Hunter!

13:46.640 --> 13:48.470
It's too dangerous. Don't go.

13:48.470 --> 13:52.230
Why must I join the sentry team?

13:52.640 --> 13:55.040
But Miss Han,
you're an E-Rank Hunter.

13:55.690 --> 13:58.480
You have the nerve to say that.

13:58.480 --> 13:59.940
I'm sorry!

13:59.940 --> 14:03.860
Considering the possibility
of ants landing on the mainland,

14:03.860 --> 14:08.370
the Association requests
all Hunters to join the sentry team.

14:13.360 --> 14:15.250
Finally, the Jeju Island raid mission...

14:15.710 --> 14:17.960
...is about to begin tomorrow.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.470
This is the First Fleet.

14:23.470 --> 14:25.970
We've arrived at the coastal
waters of Jeju Island.

14:26.530 --> 14:28.930
The second Fleet arrived
at the target location.

14:29.680 --> 14:32.890
The third Fleet is about
to enter the alert zone.

14:32.890 --> 14:34.980
The fourth Fleet is advancing.

14:34.980 --> 14:37.680
Estimated to arrive at the
target location in 5 minutes.

14:38.650 --> 14:42.650
Master, is our strength enough
against the ants?

14:42.650 --> 14:44.860
We won't know unless we try.

14:45.610 --> 14:49.390
Our sentry team is here
precisely for such contingencies.

14:49.390 --> 14:51.700
So the ants can't reach the mainland.

14:51.700 --> 14:53.330
Cool, Master!

14:53.330 --> 14:56.580
I, Jung Yoontae,
pledge to follow you for life.

14:58.750 --> 15:01.340
Then, I leave this place to you.

15:01.880 --> 15:04.100
We won't get to step in, anyway.

15:04.100 --> 15:06.090
We'll just be idling here all day.

15:06.090 --> 15:08.050
There's always a contingency.

15:08.390 --> 15:11.260
It's because you are here

15:11.260 --> 15:13.770
that I can depart to the front line
with peace of mind.

15:15.980 --> 15:17.540
Be careful on your way.

15:17.540 --> 15:18.190
Yep.

15:18.560 --> 15:21.980
Huh? Why was Minsung assigned there?

15:22.400 --> 15:24.440
It could be troublesome!

15:24.820 --> 15:26.400
Transfer him to the rear!

15:44.010 --> 15:46.260
We've received reports from all units.

15:46.650 --> 15:50.490
All preparations on the mainland coast
and waters surrounding Jeju Island are complete.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.970
The decoy unit has also
landed on the island.

15:54.640 --> 15:55.640
Good.

15:56.600 --> 16:01.690
Many Hunters have
responded to this operation.

16:02.400 --> 16:03.150
Furthermore,

16:03.980 --> 16:06.860
his decision to join has given us
a boost of confidence.

16:13.830 --> 16:14.990
Byung-Gu!

16:15.920 --> 16:18.120
I never thought you'd come.

16:18.120 --> 16:22.500
Without a healer like me here,
you'd get instantly killed, Yoonho.

16:22.960 --> 16:26.090
You'll charge straight at magic beasts
the moment you see them, right?

16:26.440 --> 16:29.750
If I'm slow, you'll be the one dying.

16:36.270 --> 16:38.390
This is the island's central district.

16:38.770 --> 16:41.100
This is Alpha, all units respond.

16:41.440 --> 16:43.400
Bravo, in position.

16:43.730 --> 16:45.690
Charlie, in position.

16:45.690 --> 16:48.240
Delta, ready to go.

16:50.610 --> 16:51.860
Live broadcast...

16:51.860 --> 16:52.640
Yes.

16:52.640 --> 16:55.910
However, to prevent accidents,
the footage will be delayed by 10 minutes.

16:55.910 --> 16:58.430
As a photographer from
the Hunter Report Team,

16:58.430 --> 17:01.580
I will broadcast the details
of this battle to the public.

17:01.580 --> 17:02.250
Okay.

17:02.670 --> 17:06.710
Hunters demonstrate their true abilities
when protecting others.

17:06.710 --> 17:10.590
This will be an intense battle.
Are you up for this?

17:10.930 --> 17:12.550
Rest assured.

17:12.550 --> 17:14.350
Despite appearances, I'm an A-Rank Hunter.

17:14.350 --> 17:16.100
I'm used to filming
in dangerous zones.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.190
That's good.

17:18.770 --> 17:23.980
This might be ordinary folk's last chance
to witness an S-Rank raid mission.

17:24.490 --> 17:26.690
No, we must make sure it's the final one.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.900
We must succeed this time.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.120
If this operation fails,

17:32.120 --> 17:34.870
our nation will likely
be erased from the map.

17:35.240 --> 17:38.370
This country needs heroes...

17:39.250 --> 17:43.170
The assault team is ready to deploy.

17:43.790 --> 17:45.580
Very well, I declare...

17:46.160 --> 17:48.750
...the 4th Jeju Island Raid Mission
officially commences!

17:49.110 --> 17:50.460
All units, deploy!

17:50.800 --> 17:51.760
Roger.

17:52.630 --> 17:55.220
The decoy unit is moving out.

17:55.680 --> 17:57.430
Their magical powers are terrifying.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.520
They're making their move too.

18:00.730 --> 18:03.190
Hey, they're heading this way!

18:03.190 --> 18:04.940
Open the hatch.

18:04.940 --> 18:06.880
I'll handle them.

18:16.450 --> 18:17.580
Incredible...

18:18.280 --> 18:19.950
There are many of them.

18:21.620 --> 18:23.650
Seems we'll need drastic measures.

18:31.260 --> 18:33.420
I've finally reached this place.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.760
Standing on this land once again...

18:39.810 --> 18:41.560
No wonder he's the Ultimate Hunter.

18:41.560 --> 18:42.430
Very reliable.

18:43.140 --> 18:45.850
Alright everyone, let's descend.

18:48.310 --> 18:53.150
Japan's Hunters can stall those ants
for at most one hour.

18:53.610 --> 18:57.490
Meaning we must eliminate
the queen within that timeframe.

18:58.030 --> 18:59.280
Is everyone ready?

19:00.830 --> 19:02.790
We can do this.

19:03.950 --> 19:04.910
Let's move.

19:07.670 --> 19:09.340
We're commencing our operation.

19:09.770 --> 19:11.710
Activate interference wave.

19:11.710 --> 19:13.260
Interference wave activated.

19:15.470 --> 19:20.180
Now the ants won't receive
the queen's distress signals.

19:21.600 --> 19:22.560
Yikes!

19:22.560 --> 19:25.270
Kumamoto, fear will get you killed.

19:28.650 --> 19:34.690
Could we have eliminated all these ants
before they can kill the queen?

19:34.690 --> 19:35.780
Possibly.

19:35.780 --> 19:37.110
Where is Kenzo?

19:37.510 --> 19:38.740
He's over there playing.

19:39.240 --> 19:40.320
Just like a child.

19:40.850 --> 19:42.470
Did you see those flames?

19:42.470 --> 19:44.660
It must be from that Choi guy.

19:44.660 --> 19:47.870
I wonder who would win if I fought him.

19:48.460 --> 19:50.840
It could alternating temperatures.

19:53.090 --> 19:54.400
Exits have been sealed.

19:54.400 --> 19:57.380
Let's move quickly
while they're all lured out.

19:57.380 --> 19:59.760
But there are so many tunnels.

20:00.180 --> 20:03.440
How do we find the tunnel
leading to the queen?

20:11.820 --> 20:13.770
What are you doing?
It's too dangerous.

20:14.190 --> 20:17.650
We don't have time to check each one.

20:18.400 --> 20:21.870
Just find the deepest tunnel.

20:22.450 --> 20:24.290
Looks like that's the one.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.710
My daily quest is complete.

20:33.390 --> 20:36.010
The streets are empty today.

20:38.340 --> 20:42.220
All S-Rank Hunters on this
raid mission are top-tier ones.

20:42.800 --> 20:45.020
They could easily complete the operation.

20:45.990 --> 20:47.640
Even without someone like me.

20:50.850 --> 20:53.860
Is the queen really here?

20:53.860 --> 20:55.900
Maybe it abandoned them and fled.

20:55.900 --> 20:58.570
This is an island,
so it can't go anywhere.

20:58.930 --> 21:01.030
Everyone, check this out.

21:04.580 --> 21:06.290
An egg chamber...

21:06.290 --> 21:08.660
The queen's chamber must be nearby.

21:09.930 --> 21:11.170
Look.

21:12.080 --> 21:13.330
That egg...

21:13.830 --> 21:14.790
Is that...

21:14.790 --> 21:16.710
...also an ant egg?

21:16.710 --> 21:18.420
It's enormous...

21:19.010 --> 21:22.010
Our mission is to kill the queen.

21:22.010 --> 21:23.800
Don't bother with other things.

21:24.160 --> 21:26.680
But can't blame him for reacting that way.

21:27.100 --> 21:29.060
Ant evolution remains unpredictable.

21:29.730 --> 21:34.310
If there's an ant born
from that giant egg...

21:35.650 --> 21:36.520
Darn it.

21:36.980 --> 21:39.990
Those annoying pests
made me hurt my shoulder.

21:39.990 --> 21:41.860
Want me to heal you?

21:41.860 --> 21:43.660
But it's not free.

21:43.660 --> 21:44.720
Shimizu.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.740
Quit fooling around
and heal me right away.

21:46.740 --> 21:48.740
There's something I want.

21:48.740 --> 21:50.870
Instead of money...

21:52.290 --> 21:53.370
Here we go again.

21:54.290 --> 21:55.540
Fine.

21:56.120 --> 21:57.250
What exactly do you wa—

22:42.090 --> 22:44.760
SOLO LEVELING

22:44.760 --> 22:48.260
EPISODE 22: WE NEED A HERO

23:37.480 --> 23:41.020
EPISODE 23:
IT'S GOING TO GET EVEN MORE INTENSE
