since we convert first then tokanize we cant really get the original form dumbass

my app got japanese words and onCLick i want to load the data of that specific word the data contains the translation in english and bunch of other stuff iam using the jmdict dictionry for that in a JSON format instead of the offical xml
the issue is that the file is hella huge like 124MB and conatins insane amount of records so what is the best way to deal with this ?

as for the custom backend apporach i dont want to use it unless i really have to since i wanted to host it on vercel on their free plan !
so what other solutions ?

JSON search library like fuse.js for example or what exactly

i have also read about converting it to .gz or something like that

JSL -> upload a local sub file and we show the subs and allow for search

ASL -> a user choose an anime then an episode then we fetch files and show it and allow for search
